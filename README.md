# Python Scripts

This repository consists of a list of more than 60 Python scripts, primarily those which automate a specific task. Each folder contains one or more .py files and a README to explain what that specific python script needs to run. These scripts are free to use as long as long as the original contributor is credited.

## Contributing

For new Python scripts, first create an Issue listing the script you would like to contribute to the repo. Then fork the repository and create a Pull Request which contains a README describing the script along with listing any prequisites it would need, the python file(s) themselves, and any additional files the script(s) may need. Additionally, the script should be alphabetically added to this README in the List of Scripts in Repo section below, providing a title, a link to the folder in the github, and a brief description of what the script does. 

For editing existing scripts, first create an Issue listing any problems or additions for a given script and wait for others to give input on your proposed changes. After discussion, create a pull request that also links to the issue that contains your changes, updating the List of Scripts in Repo if need be. 

Remember to close your issues once your PR has been merged! They can be reopened if needed.
