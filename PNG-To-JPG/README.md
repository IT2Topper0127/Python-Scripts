# PNG-TO-JPG 

Want a quick convertor that converts `.PNG` images to `.JPG` images within fraction of a second. This is a very light convertor that is very handy in times with huge number of image conversion.

## How to use:

- use the following command to install the requirement:
```
pip install pillow
```
- next move the main.py script to the folder with the image files that needs to be converted ~ Dont worry the script is not even over 2kb
- Now copy the path of the folder
- Now run the following command in the cmd with the folder path:
```
cd [path of your folder]
```
- Now use the following command:
```
python main.py
```

## Modules used:
- Pillow
- Glob

## Thank You
