# Run then Notify

This is a python script that will run any terminal command on a system and once the command successfully runs, it will notify you via email of its time taken and the exit code.

This can be useful in case of long running commands.

Please enter your email and password when prompted. These values are _not_ stored anywhere and are only used for the SMTP connection.
