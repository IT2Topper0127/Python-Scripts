# Duplicate Finder Script

This script scans a given directory for duplicate files based on their MD5 hash. It provides options to delete or move the duplicate files to another directory.

## Features

- Scan a directory recursively for duplicate files.
- Filter files by minimum size.
- Display a list of duplicate files.
- Option to delete or move the duplicate files.

## Usage

1. Run the script.
2. Enter the directory you want to scan for duplicates.
3. Specify the minimum file size to consider (in bytes). By default, it's set to 0, which means all files will be considered.
4. The script will display a list of duplicate files, if any.
5. Choose an action:
   - `(D)elete`: Deletes all but one of each set of duplicate files.
   - `(M)ove`: Moves all but one of each set of duplicate files to another directory.
   - `(N)o action`: Exits the script without making any changes.

## Notes

- When choosing the delete option, the script keeps the first file it encounters and deletes the rest of the duplicates.
- When choosing the move option, the script keeps the first file it encounters and moves the rest to the specified directory. If the target directory doesn't exist, it will be created.
- The script uses MD5 hashing to identify duplicates. While MD5 is fast, it's not the most secure hashing algorithm. There's a very low probability of hash collisions (different files having the same hash), but it's something to be aware of.
