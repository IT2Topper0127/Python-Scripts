# Git Setup Guide
## To initialise Git, write
```bash
git init
```

## 1. Configure your local Git
```bash
git config --global user.name "github username"
```

```bash
git config --global user.email "email address"
```

## 2.  Go to the first-contribution repository and Fork it.
* A fork is a rough copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely test and debug with changes without affecting the original project. One of the excessive use of forking is to propose changes for bug fixing.

  
* Click on Code Button and copy the URL of your forked Repository

  
## 3. Switch to your Git bash window, and enter the following :

* Clone the Forked project on your local system 



* Make the changes


## 4. Creating a Pull request
### Create a branch

* A branch is designed to encapsulate a group of changes. These changes might be thrown away, entirely rewritten or in the majority of cases theyâ€™ll be promoted into the main history of the codebase - via a merge.


* Creating a branch

```bash
git branch branch_name
```

* Checkout to the created branch

```bash
git checkout branch_name
```


* Now add the files using the git command

```bash
git add .
```
* Commit the changes to the local project

```bash
git commit -m "Added my data"
```

* Push the changes to your forked github repo
```bash
git push origin branch_name
```

## 5. Final Steps

- Click on "Contribute"
